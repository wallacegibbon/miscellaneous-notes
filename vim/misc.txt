## vim:ft=sh

## to see the start up info (which config file is loaded), run this
vim --version
#> ...
#     system vimrc file: "$VIM/vimrc"
#       user vimrc file: "$HOME/.vimrc"
#        user exrc file: "$HOME/.exrc"
#    fall-back for $VIM: "/usr/share/vim"

## which means `/usr/share/vim/vimrc` is the first one to load.
## On Mac OS X, that file set `modelines=0`, so if you want to use modeline,
## you need to reset modelines in your own .vimrc
